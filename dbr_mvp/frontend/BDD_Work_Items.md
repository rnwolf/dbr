# 🎉 Work Item Management BDD Tests Updated

Updated the Work Item Management BDD feature file and step definitions with comprehensive role-based testing.

Here's is what was implemented:

📋 Enhanced BDD Feature Coverage
✅ Role-Based Access Control Testing

 • Planner: Full CRUD operations on work items
 • Organization Admin: Full management capabilities
 • Worker: Can view and update assigned work items, but cannot create/delete
 • Viewer: Read-only access, cannot modify anything

✅ New Scenarios Added

1. Collection Integration

Scenario: Create a work item with collection assignment
   Given a collection exists in the organization
   When I create a work item with title "Feature Development", collection assignment, estimated hours 16
   Then the work item should be created successfully
   And the work item should be assigned to the collection

2. Worker Role Testing

Scenario: Worker can view and update assigned work items
   Given I am authenticated as a worker user
   And a work item is assigned to me
   When I update my assigned work item status to "In-Progress"
   Then the work item status should be updated successfully
   But when I try to create a new work item
   Then I should receive a permission denied error

3. Advanced Filtering

Scenario: Filter work items by collection
Scenario: Filter work items by priority
Scenario: Filter work items by responsible user

4. Financial and Business Data

Scenario: Work item with CCR hours requirements
Scenario: Work item with financial information
Scenario: Work item with due date

5. Organization Scoping

Scenario: Work items are scoped by organization
   When I request work items for my organization
   Then I should only see work items from my organization

🔧 Complete Step Definitions

Added over 20 new step definitions including:

 • Role-based authentication for Worker and Viewer users
 • Collection integration steps for work item assignment
 • Permission testing steps that verify 403 errors
 • Advanced filtering steps for various criteria
 • Financial data validation steps
 • Organization scoping verification steps

🎯 Key Benefits

1. Comprehensive Role Testing

 # Worker can update assigned items but not create new ones
 @when('I try to create a new work item')
 def try_create_work_item_as_worker(context):
     # Should receive permission denied error

 @when('I update my assigned work item status to "In-Progress"')
 def update_assigned_work_item_status(context):
     # Should succeed for assigned items

2. Business Logic Validation

# Test CCR hours, financial data, due dates
@when('I create a work item with title "Complex Feature", CCR hours "development: 12, testing: 4, design: 2"')
@when('I create a work item with title "Revenue Feature", estimated sales price 50000, estimated variable cost
 10000')

3. Integration Testing

# Test work item and collection integration
@given('a collection exists in the organization')
@then('the work item should be assigned to the collection')

🚀 Running the Updated Tests

 # Run all work item BDD tests
 cd dbr_mvp/frontend
 pytest tests_bdd/ -k "work_item" -v -s

 # Run specific role-based scenarios
 pytest tests_bdd/ -k "worker" -v -s
 pytest tests_bdd/ -k "viewer" -v -s

🔍 What This Achieves

 1 Security Validation: Ensures role-based permissions are properly enforced
 2 Business Logic Testing: Validates work item workflows and data integrity
 3 Integration Testing: Tests work item and collection relationships
 4 Future-Proofing: Comprehensive scenarios prevent regression issues
 5 Stakeholder Clarity: Business-readable scenarios in plain English

The updated Work Item Management BDD tests now provide the same comprehensive role-based coverage as the Collections
tests, ensuring that your work item functionality is thoroughly validated and protected against future changes!
