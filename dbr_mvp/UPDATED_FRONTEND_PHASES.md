### 2. **Specification Alignment**
- Header rows configuration (Cell Zones, Variance, Index, etc.)
- Time controls with real-time clock and Fast Forward
- CCR Status Component with health indicators

### 3. **Backend Integration Focus**
- All APIs are complete and tested
- Focus on frontend consuming existing secure APIs
- No need for backend development during frontend phases

### 4. **Realistic Timeline**
- 9 days total (Days 15-23)
- Accounts for complexity of buffer board visualization
- Includes comprehensive testing and integration

### 5. **TDD Maintained**
- Every component starts with failing tests
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance and error handling validation

This updated plan leverages the completed backend and aligns with the detailed Buffer Board Components specification while maintaining the TDD approach throughout.
